&lt;p&gt;I’m not too sure what I’m going to be using this for just yet, but the topics will likely range from writeups about programs I create to rants about what’s got me frustrated recently. Expect quite a variety!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already have a couple of ideas for posts including sharing my experience developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://getentropy.tylerdakin.com&quot;&gt;Entropy&lt;/a&gt; and I’d love to build a habit of sharing my experiences as I create them. I think that’s a great way to really delve deep into what you’re learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m creating blog posts with Markdown so it’s really easy to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;show you my code inline with the posts&lt;/code&gt;! If you’re reading this, I should have an RSS feed up and running and it is hopefully linked at the bottom of the page. Feel free to add that to your RSS reader!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tyler Dakin</name></author><summary type="html">Hello! This is my blog.
