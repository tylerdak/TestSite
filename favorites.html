                            Game Collecting - Scott The Woz
                        </a>
                        <h3 class="favoritesDescription">
                            I found Scott the Woz earlier this year I think. (2020 has been so long I had to check, but, yeah, 9 months ago)
If you haven't seen any of his videos, watching this one is a great introduction to Scott's wholesome content style.
His videos typically switch between 3 categories: Game Reviews, Long Form Sketches, and Game-Related Topic Video Essays
The latter is what this video is, where Scott picks some topic and discusses it. While it is a simple premise, I find 
Scott to be incredible at sticking to interesting topics and being smart about which aspects to delve deeper into.
With this video in particular, Scott discusses the hobby of collecting video games and shows off his collection quite a bit.
I found this video really interesting, especially with the rare items Scott shows towards the end of the video. I highly recommend
giving this one a look.

                            Sub Focus & Wilkinson - Enter Night
                        </a>
                        <h3 class="favoritesDescription">
                            Okay, I realize I've pulled songs from Sub Focus and Wilkinson's Portals album 
twice already, but this song is just another one I've had on repeat that
I felt I had to share. Enter Night was the first of the new tracks
on the album (not singles) that I listened to and it is such a great
start to the album (2nd track on the album). It feels very relaxed 
in the beginning and slowly builds with a catchy melody into the drop.
I've found myself coming back to the song over and over again within
the past month so I'd highly recommend you give that a listen and,
if you haven't yet and you like this one, give the rest of the album 
a try too!

                            My girlfriend and I watched this movie early September knowing
nothing about it other than that it starred Andy Samberg and 
Cristin Milioti and featured some nice tropical aesthetics. I 
think that was definitely the best way to watch it and the only
thing more that I'm going to tell you about it is that you should
definitely give it a try!

                            Obviously, not everyone may be able to access this one but if you are I highly recommend it. 
Ted Lasso is the best example of feel good content that I've seen and it has great lessons
in being a good person and being your own person. If you have Apple TV+ (if you've recently bought an Apple device, 
you might without knowing it!), I really recommend you give it a try.
