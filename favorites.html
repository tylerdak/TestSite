                            My girlfriend and I watched this movie early September knowing
nothing about it other than that it starred Andy Samberg and 
Cristin Milioti and featured some nice tropical aesthetics. I 
think that was definitely the best way to watch it and the only
thing more that I'm going to tell you about it is that you should
definitely give it a try!

                            Obviously, not everyone may be able to access this one but if you are I highly recommend it. 
Ted Lasso is the best example of feel good content that I've seen and it has great lessons
in being a good person and being your own person. If you have Apple TV+ (if you've recently bought an Apple device, 
you might without knowing it!), I really recommend you give it a try.

                        <h3 class="favoritesDescription">
                            Sub Focus and Wilkinson just released their 
long-awaited album and it's full of absolute masterpieces! Ray of Sun
is certainly a part of those. I wasn't a huge fan of the vocals 
and more. And the melody is absolutely
originally, but they're growing on me as I listen to it more 
beautiful and something that I'll be humming to 
myself for the next while.

                            It may sound like a scam, but it's not. 
It's also not what you think it's going to be. 
Just give it a look, it's quite... uh... unique.
