                Sub Focus & Wilkinson - Ray of Sun
            </a>
            <h3 class="favoritesDescription">
                Sub Focus and Wilkinson just released their 
                long-awaited album and it's full of absolute masterpieces! Ray of Sun
                is certainly a part of those. I wasn't a huge fan of the vocals 
                originally, but they're growing on me as I listen to it more 
                and more. And the melody is absolutely
                beautiful and something that I'll be humming to 
                myself for the next while.

                My girlfriend and I watched this movie early September knowing
                nothing about it other than that it starred Andy Samberg and 
                Cristin Milioti and featured some nice tropical aesthetics. I 
                think that was definitely the best way to watch it and the only
                thing more that I'm going to tell you about it is that you should
                definitely give it a try!

                Vox - Making a Commercial with Robots
            </a>
            <h3 class="favoritesDescription">
                One interest of mine that's not programming related is video 
                editing and film making. I don't delve into it myself too
                much but I like learning how the content I watch is made. Vox
                recently put out this video showcasing how what seems to be a
                simple commercial was actually filmed. 
                <br><br> <u>Spoiler Alert:</u> It involves lots of
                cool tech and camera robots!
